### üß© Core Steps
| Stage | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Data Preparation** | Cleaned and merged `transactions`, `users`, `cards`, and `MCC` data (13M+ rows). |
| **EDA & Visualization** | Distribution, outlier, and geographic/industry-level fraud analysis. |
| **Feature Engineering** | Constructed 20+ numerical, categorical, and time-based features (`amount_log`, `is_refund`, `hour`, `mcc_desc`, etc.). |
| **Class Balancing** | Undersampling strategy (10√ó ratio) to stabilize LightGBM training. |
| **Model Training** | Tuned LightGBM (GBDT) with early stopping and AUC optimization. |
| **Explainability (SHAP)** | Interpreted feature contributions globally and locally (fraud driver visualization). |
| **Threshold Tuning** | Optimized precision‚Äìrecall trade-off with decision curve visualization. |
| **Business Application** | Exported Top-200 high-risk transactions for manual verification. |

## üìä Model Performance

### Before & After Threshold Optimization

| Metric                 | Default Threshold (0.5) | Tuned Threshold (0.1598) |          Œî Improvement |
| :--------------------- | ----------------------: | -----------------------: | ---------------------: |
| **AUC (Validation)**   |                  0.9718 |                   0.9718 |                      ‚Äî |
| **Precision**          |                  0.0374 |                   0.0379 |                +0.0005 |
| **Recall**             |                  0.1601 |               **0.4941** |            **+0.3340** |
| **F1 Score**           |                  0.0606 |               **0.0704** |                +0.0098 |
| **Detection Coverage** |                   0.74% |                **2.28%** | ‚Üë Expanded audit scope |

**Interpretation:**  
- After tuning the decision threshold, Recall improved from **16.0% ‚Üí 49.4%**, tripling fraud coverage while maintaining similar precision (~0.04).  
- The optimized configuration balances model confidence and operational feasibility ‚Äî ideal for financial audit pipelines where human verification capacity is limited.

## üåç Explainability
- **Global Importance:** `amount_log`, `hour`, `mcc_desc`, and `client_mean` drive fraud prediction.  
- **Local Explanation:** SHAP force plots reveal how transaction timing and amount deviations trigger risk alerts.  
- **Interpretability Goal:** bridge **model confidence** and **financial analyst reasoning**.
